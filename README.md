# Measles Resurgence in England: Spotlight on Children and Major Cities

> I chose to explore measles trends in England due to its growing public health importance, especially with the recent resurgence in cases.
The data provides a compelling narrative linking declining vaccination rates to increased vulnerability — particularly among young children and in urban centres such as London and Manchester.



#### 📊  What I Visualised:

1. Timeline of Measles Cases (2020–2024)
Highlights the post-2023 surge, which led to the national incident declaration in January 2024.

2. Heatmap: Cases by Region and Age
Reveals that children aged 1–9 years in major cities are the most affected group.

#### 🧵 Why This Matters?

These insights not only show the epidemiological trend, but also help contextualise the public health policy response:

* 📉 Falling MMR vaccination coverage

* 🏥 Coordinated response in Greater Manchester

* 💉 Nationwide, phased MMR catch-up campaign launched by NHS England
